I find the idea of hidding icons in the canvas very original, the mouse acts as a lamp that reveals that these elements where there since the beginning.
The eyes rotate perfectly too and the background changes letting a sky appearing on the screen when we press the mouse. Even if the character itself is somehow simple, the program works very well and is very interactive. This work might symbolize everyday's thoughts and interests versus the calm of the dreams since we can see a character stood in the sky if we press the mouse.
Regarding the program, the function 'move cover' as put below, is the core of this system of flashlight that i find really original.
The idea was represented using 'Ifs' that change values of variables, very interesting.


function moveCover() {
    const d = dist(flashlight.x, flashlight.y, cover.x, cover.y);
    const overlap = (d < flashlight.size / 2 + cover.size / 2);
    if (overlap) {
        flashlight.fill = cover.fills.overlap;

        if (overlap && flashlight.x < (cover.x)) {
            cover.fill = "#00000000"; // if the flashlight and the cover overlaps then the cover turns transparent
        }

        if (overlap && flashlight.y < (cover.y)) {
            cover.fill = "#00000000"; // if the flashlight and the cover overlaps then the cover turns transparent
        }

        if (overlap && flashlight.y > (cover.y)) {
            cover.fill = "#00000000"; // if the flashlight and the cover overlaps then the cover turns transparent
        }

        if (overlap && flashlight.x > (cover.x)) {
            cover.fill = "#00000000"; // if the flashlight and the cover overlaps then the cover turns transparent
        }
    }
    else {
        cover.fill = "#0d4f4b"; // if there is no overlapping the color goes back to the original color
    }
}


The pupils'movements were also restricted so that they stay in the center of the eyebowls, which was done using the following variable :
  
    let maxOffset = eyeRadius - pupilRadius - 2;
    
Finally, the function "pupilOffset" make the movements of the eyes possible for the user when he moves the mouse using 'mouseX' and 'mouseY' which is very intersting altough it is not fully explained in the comments.

In this work, there is something that I have found awesome which is the user interactivity !
The character has on purpose not been fully completed, her hair is missing as well as her 'makeup'as stated in the speech buble, although for me a mouth is also missing... Anyways, my point here is that elements are missing, but we, as the spectators, have the possibility to draw them ourselves, to complete the character. I find this idea very original. The star that acts as a pen following the movements of the mouse is also very cool. Plus, it spins, which recall us that we HAVE to use it ! In the program, this idea of letting the viewer act on the character is even stated in the comments :"I also thought that something that kinda reprents me is my love for eyeliner and my creative use of it when I can. - so I made the user able to draw me one or just be creative.", and it works ! 

The lines of code i have found interesting are the following : 

const speechAlt ={
    x: 540,
    y: 770,
    x2: 580,
    y2: 790,
    fill: '#c2ffbcff',
    size: 100,
   //make the guy (me) say two things over time
    strs:{
        hey: 'Hello!!',
        text: 'I have no arm but still seak new\n makeup and hair or anything cool \n if you would be so kind to draw it \n   on me â™¡ :3 ',
        
    } ,
}
    
It represents the speech buble that we see in the program that litteraly tells us we can draw, i like this idea to actually talk to the viewer directly and tell him what he can do. This speech buble changes the meaning of the program because we are not destroying a portrait by making lines everywhere, as we should think if this speech buble was not there, here we are simply interacting on a program in which we are welcomed to try things and be creative.

In this artwork, I really like the consistency. I did something similar in mine, adding shapes one by one, here it is the same process, each square was added to form a self portrait, we can see it in the program, with a long list of rectangles of same dimensions, but different places and colors. The interactivity here is made by changing the place of the pupils of the eyes as well as changing the background's color depending on where the mouse is located in the screen. As a consequence, it's easy to say that it was made using mouseX and mouseY.

In the program, what i find particularly interesting is the eyes'movements. 

//EYE MOVEMENT
    let leftEyeX = constrain(mouseX, 200, 240)
    let rightEyeX = leftEyeX + 120;

    let leftEyeHighlightY = constrain(mouseY, 200, 220)
    let rightEyeHighlightY = leftEyeHighlightY
    
This is the formula that was used to make them move. What i find funny here is that it changes by square. The white square that symbolizes the pupil only moves by squares, so it's wheter top or bottom, as in pixels drawings, and it works for sure !
