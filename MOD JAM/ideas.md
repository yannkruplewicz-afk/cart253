    DrawScore()
1    //draws the score, different flies flies have different size and gives different numbers of points if eaten, so the player prefers to eat small ones which are also the harder ones
big ones = 0.5, medium ones = 1 and small ones = 3

2   // a streak as in duolingo should be added after having captured 3 small ones, or 15 flies in total which brings adrenaline and sticks the player to the screen, he doesn't want to stop playing

3   // the flies should have a curved trajectory, not just flying straight and going from point 50,x to point 50,y on the screen so that it is harder for the player and less repetitive 
DONE

4   // once attacked at first, the flies should be able to escape, to avoid the first attack in 50% of the cases, not 100%. so the player doesn't know how they are going to react at all but can anticipate if it happens.
DONE

5   // the score could be placed in the frog itself so that is it visible ( black in light green ) as well as practical since it doesn't disturb the player from seeing the flies

6   // both the frog and the flies should have a themed design. Maybe they can be the frog and the flies from the future, the frog could have glasses through which we see big eyes , as well as a turn on / off button on her back that the player has to turn on at the beggining of the game using the 'space' touch.
DONE

The flies could have a variable that make their color change from light green to dark green as well as wings.
DOONE



7   // the background should also have a design related to them, like clouds moving in the same sense as the flies, they would go faster as the flies go faster during the strikes
DONE

8   // the score loses 1 every 5 seconds to add more spice, so that if the player does nothing, he can loose
DONE

9   // the score begins at 5 at the start because i don't want the player to loose immediately
DONE

10  // a sound of frog when the tong is used to captivate different senses of the player
DONE

11  // continous sounds of flies to really show that the black dots are flies 
DONE

12  // background music of nature to give a context of nature 
DONE

13  // emote song when the game begins, after the beggining screen to make it more attractive and interactive
done

17  // a new music is also added when the player looses, leading him to the loser screen
done

21  // there is a timer, if player didn't reach x number of points before the 1 min is called, they lose, and it goes on and on.
done





14  // emote song in case of strike to make the game more interactive and tell the player ' you're in fire man '

15  // when there is a strike, the borders of the screen become different as well as the frog and the flies
the frog now has focused eyebrows and sweets, we can see it in her face

16  // a new music is added during the strike to replace the nature background music


18  // flies arrive faster during the strike

19  // the strike's duration is 30 secs. if the player catches 25 flies in this set of time, a new strike even harder happens, it's the hardest level
there, the frog's eyebrows are really focused , she also sweets a lot, this last strike takes place during 30 secs


22  // things fall from the sky and takes points away from the frog, during strikes they fall more often and are really dangerous.
