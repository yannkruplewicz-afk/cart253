Subway surfer king of game.

so same as subway surfer, character runs and has 3 paths while obstacles arrive.
he moves thanks to the arrows on the keyboard

on the right and left sides you can see the building and cars / nature passing by.

regarding the score, you win one point every second. the final score is 2500, once you reach it, you're done, your score is saved as 'best score' and the screen fades progressively while the obstacles disappear ( you cant loose anymore ). When he wins he runs very fast by himself to the white light that leads we dont know where, as in old pokemon video games and then you find yourself back to the instructions screen.

the character is wearing headphones in the us, the sound is fully hearable

the character in spain hears the song thanks to speakers in the city, there are sounds of corwds.

in quebec, he has a speaker in his bag ( Ryan's reference ), Ryan like style character

if the player bumps into an obstacle, there is a sound effect of ARGH and the music's volume turns down for 5 seconds. 3 bumps you loose.
When you loose, the character falls and the camera shows the character from above, the music stops gradually, there is also a soundtrack of defeat.
