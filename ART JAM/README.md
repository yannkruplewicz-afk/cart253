## Description

This autoportrait represents me in a picture my mother took with her camera, i have tried to represent it as realistic as possible, hence the use of shadows. Altough the cartoon style gives it a sense of uniqueness



## Screenshot(s)

This bit should have some images of the program running so that the reader has a sense of what it looks like. For example:

As we can see in the pictures, the functions are organised and there is a mask function. In this program i have used a function 'FrameMask' to block my portait into a frame, but if we look closely we  can see that the hair are out of the frame, which was my intention because the character looks like a cartoon and lots of gags in cartoons are based on breaking rules like that. I have also used different functions that i haven't used before to help me be more accurate regarding the details, hence the function called 'DetailsNeck' in my program.
